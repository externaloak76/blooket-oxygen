/* 
 If you came here for the scripts, ok i guess but they are not fully out yet they are very buggy and if i release now they will will probally get patched, sorry.
 although you can implement them yourself with the list of the apis on the readme.md, i'll try releasing this in javascript instead and you would be able to run it
 in the chrome browser or as a bookmarklet.
